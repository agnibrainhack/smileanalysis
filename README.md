# Smileanalysis
This project was performed during the winter break of 2017. This particular repository is for the serverside logic for an emotion detection application.
The python server uses opencv library for face detection. The face is furthur analysed to determine the emotions. 
The full project comes with an android application where the user uploads his/her image and in subsequent network calls his emotions gets detected.
We have not used any third party ml/face recognition software.
Everything is the done in old school way.
